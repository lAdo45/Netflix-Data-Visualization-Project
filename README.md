# Netflix-Data-Visualization-Project

ðŸ“Š Netflix Shows and Movies Data Visualization
This project explores and visualizes data related to Netflix's collection of TV shows and movies using Python and Matplotlib. The dataset includes information like type, release year, country, duration, and content rating.

The goal of this notebook is to help understand Netflix's content trends through clear and insightful visualizations. Below is a breakdown of each graph used in this project, with descriptions to explain what each visualization reveals.

ðŸ“Œ 1.  Movies vs TV Shows Count

This bar graph compares the number of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix.

Movies make up the majority of the content.

TV Shows are fewer in number but have grown significantly over time as serialized content has become more popular.



ðŸ“Œ 2.Content Rating Distribution

This pie chart shows the percentage share of various content ratings (like TV-MA, PG-13, R, etc.).

TV-MA (Mature Audience) dominates the platform, followed by TV-14.

This shows Netflix focuses heavily on content for older teens and adults.



ðŸ“Œ 3.  Movie Duration Distribution

This histogram displays the distribution of movie durations (in minutes).

Most Netflix movies have durations between 80 to 120 minutes, which is standard for feature-length films.

There are few outliers with very short or very long durations, showing Netflix sticks mostly to typical film lengths.

ðŸ“Œ 4.Release Year vs Number of Shows

This scatter plot shows how many shows were released each year.

There's a dramatic increase in the number of titles released after 2010, peaking around 2018â€“2020.

The growth highlights Netflix's push toward original content in recent years.


ðŸ“Œ 5. Top 10 Countries by Number of Shows

This horizontal bar chart shows the top 10 countries producing the most content available on Netflix.

United States leads by a large margin with the highest number of titles, followed by India and United Kingdom.

Other countries like Japan, South Korea, and France also contribute significantly to Netflixâ€™s global library.

ðŸ“Œ 6. Comparison of Movies and TV Shows Released per Year

This line chart compares how many movies and TV shows were released each year.

Both categories saw major growth starting from 2010.

The release of TV shows particularly accelerated between 2015â€“2020, showing Netflix's increasing investment in episodic content.
